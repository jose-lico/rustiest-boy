# rustiest-boy
Another GameBoy emulator built in Rust

## Goals

To build a cross platform GameBoy Color emulator in Rust.

    - Support for desktop platforms and .wasm
    - Support for most gameboy color cartridge types and features
    - Farfetched: Support for link cable emulation and save data

I'm building this with the intention of learning a bit about rust as well as the whole .wasm thing.
